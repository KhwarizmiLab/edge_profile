-   figure out where nan columns such as "avg_us_nan" come from in aggregated csv (zero_noexe as example)
-   get rid of redundant indicator columns, because indicator will be the same for min, max, etc.
-   implement recursive feature selection
-   implement different classification schemes, maybe one of them can get more accuracy on system data only.
-   experiment with pretrained vs not.
-   add column for number of inferences and input type
-   create script to collect multiple input types
-   deploy on jetson nano
-   try with different frameworks, like tflite
